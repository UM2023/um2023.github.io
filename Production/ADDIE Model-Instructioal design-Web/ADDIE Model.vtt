00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.112
Whether you are brand new to world of instructional design or eLearning development, or you

00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:08.647
are trying to get into it for the first time. You will use the ADDIE model. So,

00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:13.282
lets understand it.
ADDIE Model is a
Systematic Instructional

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:18.197
Design Framework
Analyze 
Gap in learning and goal

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:23.382
Design
Objectives, Content, Assessment, Delivery.

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:28.572
Develop 
Create and put together course materials.
Implement

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:33.449
Deliver the course.
Evaluate 
Assess the knowledge gained.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:36.624
Now we will deep dive into it. And understand it.

00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:37.443
Analize

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:39.687
Can we just skip to PowerPoint slides?

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.062
The team gathers in a meeting room, staring at each other like, “Why are we doing this training

00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:44.742
again?”

00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:49.188
No, Karen, we need to know what learners actually need first.
A –

00:00:49.338 --> 00:00:53.800
Analyze: Identify the learning problem, audience needs, existing knowledge,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.607
and goals.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.305
This initial phase involves identifying the learning needs, goals, and constraints.

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:03.617
Instructional designers assess the target audience's existing knowledge and skills to ensure

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:07.697
that the training aligns with their needs. Key questions addressed include what learners

00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:10.718
need to know and the context in which the instruction will occur.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.354
Design
This is when sticky notes take over the walls, and someone

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:21.102
draws a mind map that looks suspiciously like a spaghetti monster.
Objectives?

00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:24.295
Check. Confused stares? Double check.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:29.295
First D in ADDIE is Design
Plan learning objectives, content structure, assessments,

00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:30.546
and delivery methods.

00:01:30.683 --> 00:01:34.733
In this phase, designers outline the learning objectives and create a detailed plan for the

00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:39.425
instructional materials. This includes selecting appropriate instructional strategies,

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:43.803
determining the content structure, and designing assessments to measure learning outcomes.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.934
Develop
Second D in ADDIE is Develop
Create and assemble

00:01:50.084 --> 00:01:54.142
course materials, including media, activities, and prototypes.

00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:58.542
The content team disappears for three weeks and returns with 400 slides, 10

00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:02.697
videos, and a game where you battle compliance dragons.
Someone inevitably

00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:07.257
asks, “Do we need the dramatic theme music when opening the module?” Yes.

00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:11.699
Yes, we do.
During development, the actual instructional materials

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.891
are created based on the design plan. This may involve writing content,

00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:20.221
creating multimedia elements, and assembling the course materials. Testing

00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.893
and revisions are also conducted to ensure quality.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.792
During development, the actual instructional materials are created based on the design plan.

00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:32.092
This may involve writing content, creating multimedia elements, and assembling

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:36.693
the course materials. Testing and revisions are also conducted to ensure quality.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.784
Evaluate
Finally the E is Evaluate
Assess the

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:44.972
effectiveness of the training through both formative (ongoing) and summative (

00:02:45.122 --> 00:02:49.452
final) evaluations.
The final phase consists of both formative

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:53.994
and summative evaluations. Formative evaluation occurs throughout the ADDIE process

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:58.469
to gather feedback and make improvements, while summative evaluation assesses the effectiveness

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:02.599
of the training after implementation. 
Now we find out if the learners retained

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.845
anything… or if they just clicked “Next” until the confetti animation played.

00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:11.601
Implement
The I in ADDIE is Implement.
Deliver the course to learners,

00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:14.625
train facilitators, and ensure all systems are go.

00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:18.800
The training finally launches!
Half the team can't log in, one person’s

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.930
watching from a beach, and your boss insists on watching it at 2x speed to “save time.”
"

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.231
Oops" Please fix the issues and launch again.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.742
This phase involves delivering the instructional materials to the learners. It includes

00:03:30.892 --> 00:03:35.367
training facilitators, preparing learners, and ensuring that all necessary resources

00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:37.136
are available for effective learning.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.204
ADDIE model 
In short is a systematic instructional design framework

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:46.034
used to create effective learning experiences. It stands for Analyze, Design,

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:50.864
Develop, Implement, and Evaluate, each representing a phase in the process.

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:55.027
The model is a flexible, adaptable, and iterative approach to developing training

00:03:55.177 --> 00:03:59.432
programs and learning materials. 
I can't think of better model that's more widely

00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:01.786
known or used in our industry than ADDIE Model.
