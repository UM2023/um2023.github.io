INTRODUCTION
A Record Management System (RMS) is a tool or software that

00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:38.270
helps organizations keep track of their important documents and information.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.065
It allows users to store, organize, and retrieve records easily. This system

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:47.059
ensures that records are maintained securely and can be accessed when needed,

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:51.215
making it easier for businesses to manage their data efficiently.

MODULE 1: INTRODUCTION TO 
RECORD MANAGEMENT

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:30.067
Importance Of Records In Organizations
Why We Hoard Data Like It’s Gold!

00:01:30.217 --> 00:01:34.188
The Origins of Record-Keeping - From ancient stone tablets to today’s cloud

00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:38.774
servers. (Imagine trying to search for a record on a rock-good luck!)
Records

00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:42.245
in organizations are essential documents that help keep track of important

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:46.483
information. They can include anything from financial statements to employee

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:51.278
records. Having accurate and organized records allows organizations to operate

00:01:51.428 --> 00:01:55.562
smoothly, make informed decisions, and comply with laws and regulations.

00:01:55.712 --> 00:01:59.683
In simple terms, records are like a roadmap that guides organizations in

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:02.052
their daily activities and long-term planning.

00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:07.081
Types of records 
Data is the new oil!
Records are important pieces of

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:11.214
information that help us keep track of various activities and data. There

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:16.020
are three main types of records:
1. Physical records: These are tangible

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.863
items like paper documents, files, or photographs that you can hold in your

00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:25.157
hand.
2. Digital records: These are electronic files stored on computers

00:02:25.307 --> 00:02:30.208
or online, such as emails, digital photos, or documents saved in cloud storage.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:35.757
3. Transactional records: These are records that document specific transactions

00:02:35.907 --> 00:02:40.622
or activities, like receipts from purchases, bank statements, or invoices.

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:40.796


00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:42.636
Types of records Continued

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:46.364
A comprehensive understanding of these record types enhances our ability

00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:50.904
to manage information efficiently in both personal and professional contexts.

00:02:51.054 --> 00:02:56.918
In short there are three types of records physical vs. digital vs. “that

00:02:57.068 --> 00:02:59.483
one document nobody knows where to file.”

00:03:10.442 --> 00:03:14.495
Laws and regulations affecting record management
Avoid legal pickle and

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:18.628
courtroom drama!
Record management refers to the way organizations handle

00:03:18.778 --> 00:03:22.552
their documents and information. This includes how they create, store, and

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:26.789
dispose of records. Laws and regulations are rules set by governments that

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.481
organizations must follow to ensure they manage their records properly.

00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:35.148
These rules help protect people's privacy and ensure that important information

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:41.174
is kept safe and secure.
Legal Compliance and Governance - Meet the alphabet

00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:47.002
soup of regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, ISO), otherwise known as “the rules that

00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:49.022
keep your company out of lawsuits.”

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:54.259
The Drama of Lost Records 
Missing data Chaos!
Famous cases where mismanaged

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.369
records led to disaster (Ever heard of an entire country losing its tax

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.373
records? Yeah, it happened!).
Example—like the time an entire country lost

00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:08.098
its tax records, such as the 2008 incident in the UK where HM Revenue and

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:13.114
Customs lost 25 million child benefit records. It's a stark reminder of

00:04:13.264 --> 00:04:17.305
the importance of effective record management!
So mismanaged records can

00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:21.519
be likened to a ship navigating without a map; just as a lost vessel can

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.664
find itself in treacherous waters, disorganized documentation can steer

00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:30.529
a nation into chaos, exemplified by a country losing all its tax records.

00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:34.523
MODULE 2: DESIGNING A RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:41.740
Key components of an RMS
Organizing Chaos Like a Pro
A Risk Management

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.405
System (RMS) helps organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks. Creating

00:04:47.555 --> 00:04:51.481
a Classification System - The art of labeling files correctly so they don’t

00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:56.914
vanish into the abyss.
Key components include: 
1. Risk identification:

00:04:57.064 --> 00:05:02.557
recognizing potential risks.
2. Risk assessment: evaluating likelihood

00:05:02.707 --> 00:05:08.118
and impact of risks.
3. Risk control measures: implementing strategies

00:05:08.268 --> 00:05:13.842
to minimize or eliminate risks.
4. Continuous monitoring and review: ensuring

00:05:13.992 --> 00:05:19.182
effectiveness of risk management strategies.
5. Communication and training:

00:05:19.332 --> 00:05:22.282
fostering a culture of risk awareness among stakeholders.

00:05:22.475 --> 00:05:28.130
Structuring and categorizing records
Organizing Chaos Like A Pro
1. Identify

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.704
the types of records to organize.
2. Determine a categorization method

00:05:32.854 --> 00:05:38.068
(e.g., by date, type).
3. Create a structured framework for organization.

00:05:38.218 --> 00:05:43.734
4. Implement the organization system consistently.
5. Regularly review

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.640
adding details to records saves you from playing detective when searching

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.353
later.
Building a Foolproof Filing Strategy - Preventing the dreaded “Where

00:05:56.503 --> 00:05:58.733
did that document go?!” scenario.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:04.016

Data protection and confidentiality
Keeping Secrets Like a Spy Movie
Security

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.590
and Compliance - involves measures and rules organizations implement to

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.315
protect sensitive information and adhere to laws and regulations. This ensures

00:06:57.465 --> 00:07:01.367
data safety from unauthorized access and helps build customer trust while

00:07:01.517 --> 00:07:07.137

Your coworker, Alex, accidentally accesses sensitive HR

00:13:55.015 --> 00:13:59.683
salary records. He wasn’t supposed to have permission-but somehow, he does.

00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:04.804
How can this issue be prevented in the future?
A) Conduct an access control

00:14:04.954 --> 00:14:09.587
audit to verify permissions.
B) Tell Alex to keep it secret and hope for

00:14:09.737 --> 00:14:14.672
the best.
C) Move all HR records to a locked filing cabinet (because physical

00:14:14.822 --> 00:14:20.164
security is flawless, right?)
D) Change all passwords to "1234" for easy

00:14:20.314 --> 00:14:22.985
tracking (just kidding, never do this)

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:27.945
