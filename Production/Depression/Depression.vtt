00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.216
Every day, millions of people fight silent battles no one can see.

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:08.939
Behind the smiles, the routines, and the brave faces—there’s a story.

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.798
This video is for them. For us. For everyone who’s ever felt overwhelmed,

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:17.992
unheard, or simply not okay. Today isn’t just about awareness—

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:22.191
it’s about understanding, empathy, and breaking the stigma. Because

00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:26.734
the more we talk, the more we heal. So let’s begin... with openness,

00:00:26.884 --> 00:00:30.485
honesty, and heart.
 DEPRESSION lets talk

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.738
You don't always see it... but it's there. 
The heavy thoughts behind the quiet

00:00:35.888 --> 00:00:39.839
smile. The weight someone carries while showing up like nothing’s wrong.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.768
Mental health isn’t always visible—but it’s real.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:46.849
“Behind this smile…” or “After this laugh…”
Behind this smile is

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.187
a story not everyone knows. It's not just joy—it's resilience,

00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:54.835
healing, and the strength to keep going even when the days feel heavy.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.774
I feel like I’m drowning while everyone else breathes just fine.

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.083
Do we know if our loved one has it.

00:01:02.517 --> 00:01:06.764
You don’t have to fix someone. Just show up.
Listen. Reach

00:01:06.914 --> 00:01:08.871
out. Remind them they’re not alone.

00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:10.831
So help by being there for them.
